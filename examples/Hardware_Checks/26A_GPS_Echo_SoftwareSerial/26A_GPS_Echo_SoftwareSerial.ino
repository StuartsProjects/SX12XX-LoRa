  Program Operation - This is a simple program to test a GPS. It reads characters from the GPS using
  software serial and sends them (echoes) to the IDE serial monitor. If your ever having problems with
  a GPS (or just think you are) use this program first.

  If you get no data displayed on the serial monitor, the most likely cause is that you have the receive
  data pin into the Arduino (RX) pin connected incorrectly.

  If the data displayed on the serial terminal appears to be random text with odd symbols its very
  likely you have the GPS serial baud rate set incorrectly.

  Note that not all pins on all Arduinos will work with software serial, see here;

  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial

  Serial monitor baud rate is set at 115200.

#define RXpin A3              //this is the pin that the Arduino will use to receive data from the GPS
#define TXpin A2              //this is the pin that the Arduino can use to send data (commands) to the GPS - not used

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

SoftwareSerial GPS(RXpin, TXpin);

{
  while (GPS.available())
  {
    Serial.write(GPS.read());

  Serial.println("26A_GPS_Echo_SoftwareSerial Starting");
