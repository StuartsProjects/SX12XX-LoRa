//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of the Tracker boards, the ESP32_Micro_Node, be sure to change
//them to match your own setup. You will also need to connect up the pins for the SPI bus, which on the
//ESP32_Micro_Node are SCK on pin 18, MISO on pin 19 and MOSI on pin 23.
