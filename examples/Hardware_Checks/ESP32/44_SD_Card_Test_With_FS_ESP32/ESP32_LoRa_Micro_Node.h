//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of the Tracker boards, the ESP32_Micro_Node, be sure to change
//them to match your own setup. You will also need to connect up the pins for the SPI bus, which on the
//ESP32_Micro_Node are SCK on pin 13, MISO on pin 19 and MOSI on pin 23. Some pins such as DIO1, DIO2 and
//BUZZER may not be in used by this sketch so they do not need to be connected and should be set to -1.

#define SWITCH1 0                    //pin number to attach switch 
#define LED1 2                       //pin number for LED
#define SDCS  13                     //ESP32 pin number for device select on SD card module
#define VCCPOWER 14                  //pin controls power to external devices, such as the SD card
