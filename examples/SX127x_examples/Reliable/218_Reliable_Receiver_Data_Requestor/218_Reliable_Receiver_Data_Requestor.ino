/*******************************************************************************************************
  Program Operation - This is a demonstration of the transmission and acknowledgement of 'Reliable'
  packets to request information or operations from a remote receiver.

  A reliable packet has 4 bytes automatically appended to the end of the buffer\array that is the data
  payload. The first two bytes appended are a 16bit 'NetworkID'. The receiver needs to have the same
  NetworkID as configured for the transmitter since the receiver program uses the NetworkID to check that
  the received packet is from a known source.  The third and fourth bytes appended are a 16 bit CRC of
  the payload. The receiver will carry out its own CRC check on the received payload and can then verify
  this against the CRC appended in the packet. The receiver is thus able to check if the payload is valid.

  The transmitter sends a request for the receiver which will respond with an acknowledge whach can include
  any data requested. The transmitted request is a total of 6 or more bytes, with one byte for the payload
  type and another byte for station the request is directed to.

  The request is for the receiver to return a set of GPS co-ordinates. This information is included in the
  acknowledge the receiver sends if there is a match for request type and station number. The orginal network
  ID and payload CRC are also returned with the acknowledge so the transmitter can verify if the packet it
  receives in reply is geniune.

  The matching transmitter program is 217_Reliable_Transmitter_Data_Requestor.
  Serial monitor baud rate should be set at 115200.
