//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of my own boards, a ESP32 shield base with BBF board shield on
//top. Be sure to change the definitions to match your own setup. Some pins such as DIO2, DIO3, BUZZER
//may not be in used by this sketch so they do not need to be connected and should be included and be 
//set to -1.
