//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of my own boards, the Easy Pro Mini,
//be sure to change the definitions to match your own setup. Some pins such as DIO1,
//DIO2, BUZZER may not be in used by this sketch so they do not need to be
//connected and should be set to -1.

#define RFBUSY 7                                //busy pin on LoRa device
#define DIO1 3                                  //DIO1 pin on LoRa device, used for RX and TX done
