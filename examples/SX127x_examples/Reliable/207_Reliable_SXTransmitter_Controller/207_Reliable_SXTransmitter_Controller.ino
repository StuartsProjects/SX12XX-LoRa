/*******************************************************************************************************
  Program Operation - This is a basic demonstration of the transmission of a 'Reliable' packet used to
  control outputs on a remote receiver.

  A reliable packet has 4 bytes automatically appended to the end of the buffer\array that is the data
  payload. The first two bytes appended are a 16bit 'NetworkID'. This receiver needs to have the same
  NetworkID as configured for the transmitter. The receiver program uses the NetworkID to check that
  the received packet is from a known source.  The third and fourth bytes appended are a 16 bit CRC of
  the payload. The receiver will carry out its own CRC check on the received payload and can then verify
  this against the CRC appended to the packet. The receiver is thus able to check if the payload is valid.

  For a packet to be accepted by the receiver, the networkID and payload CRC appended to the packet by the
  transmitter need to match those from the receiver which gives a high level of assurance that the packet
  is valid.

  This example program and the matching receiver, 208_Reliable_SXReceiver_Controller writes a series
  of variables direct into the LoRa devices internal buffer, it is not necessary to write variables to a
  memory array first. The receiver then reads the matching variables direct from the LoRa devices buffer and
  these variables contain the control information to flash a LED attached to the receiver on and off.

  Serial monitor baud rate should be set at 115200.
