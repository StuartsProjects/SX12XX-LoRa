//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of my own boards, the Easy Pro Mini, 
//be sure to change the definitiosn to match your own setup. Some pins such as DIO1,
//DIO2 may not be in used by this sketch so they do not need to be connected and should
//be set to -1.
