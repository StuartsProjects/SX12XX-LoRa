//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of my own boards based on a ATMega328 ProMini 
//be sure to change the definitions to match your own setup.

#define NRESET 9                                //reset pin on LoRa device

#define DIO0 3                                  //DIO0 pin on LoRa device, used for RX and TX done
