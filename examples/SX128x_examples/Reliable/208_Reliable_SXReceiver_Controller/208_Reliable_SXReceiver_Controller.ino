/*******************************************************************************************************
  Program Operation - This is a simple demonstration of the receipt of a 'Reliable' packet.

  A reliable packet has 4 bytes automatically appended to the end of the buffer\array that is the data
  payload. The first two bytes appended are a 16bit 'NetworkID'. This receiver needs to have the same
  NetworkID as configured for the transmitter. The receiver program uses the NetworkID to check that
  the received packet is from a known source.  The third and fourth bytes appended are a 16 bit CRC of
  the payload. The receiver will carry out its own CRC check on the received payload and can then verify
  this against the CRC appended to the packet. The receiver is thus able to check if the payload is valid.

  For a packet to be accepted by the receiver, the networkID and payload CRC appended to the packet by the
  transmitter need to match those from the receiver which gives a high level of assurance that the packet
  is valid.

  This example program and the matching transmitter, 207_Reliable_SXTransmitter_Controller reads a
  series of variables direct from the packet received in the LoRa devices internal buffer, it is not necessary
  to read variables to a memory array first. The receiver then uses these variables as the control information
  to flash a LED attached to the receiver on and off.

  Serial monitor baud rate should be set at 115200.
