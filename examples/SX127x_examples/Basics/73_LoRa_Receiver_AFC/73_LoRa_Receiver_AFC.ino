/*******************************************************************************************************
  Program Operation - This is demonstration of using automatic frequency adjustments (AFC) on a receiver
  to keep the frequency difference between transmitter and receiver as low as possible. The LoRa settings
  used are defined in the Settings.h file.

  If a packet is received OK, then all that is needed is a call to the LT.doAFC() function, that reads the
  last frequency error, calculates the new offset and changes the set frequency accordingly.

  When the receiver starts the frequency error may be as large as 4000hz, when the AFC operates the error
  should reduce to 100hz or so. The first AFC correction to run is doAFCPPM(); which based on the frequency
  error also adjusts the PPM setting. If doAFC(); were only used then as the frequency error is reduced then
  the PPM adjustment would reduce.

  Note that the maximum permitted frequency error between transmitter and receiver is 25% of the bandwidth
  in use. So at 125000hz bandwidth the maximum frequency error is 31500hz, if the bandwidth is 7800hz the
  maximum frequency error is 1950hz. Whilst the AFC functionality can keep transmitter and receiver close
  together when reception is working if the transmitter and receiver are to far apart in frequency for
  reception to work in the first place then AFC cannot operate to correct for the frequency differences.

  Serial monitor baud rate is set at 9600.
