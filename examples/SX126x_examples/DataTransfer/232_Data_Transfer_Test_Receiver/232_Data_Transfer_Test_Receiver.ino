/*******************************************************************************************************
  Program Operation - This is a program that simulates the transfer of a file using data transfer (DT)
  packet functions from the SX126X library. No SD cards are needed for the simulation. Use with matching
  receiver program 231_Transfer_Test_Transmitter.ino.

  DT packets can be used for transfering large amounts of data in a sequence of packets or segments,
  in a reliable and resiliant way. The remote file open request, the segements sent and the remote file close
  will be transmitted until a valid acknowledge comes from the receiver.

  Each DT packet contains a variable length header array and a variable length data array as the payload.
  On transmission the NetworkID and CRC of the payload are appended to the end of the packet by the library
  routines. The use of a NetworkID and CRC ensures that the receiver can validate the packet to a high degree
  of certainty. The receiver will not accept packets that dont have the appropriate NetworkID or payload CRC
  at the end of the packet.

  The transmitter sends a sequence of segments in order and the receiver keeps track of the sequence. If
  the sequence fails for some reason, the receiver will return a NACK packet to the transmitter requesting
  the segment sequence it was expecting.

  Details of the packet identifiers, header and data lengths and formats used are in the file
  Data_transfer_packet_definitions.md in the \SX126X_examples\DataTransfer\ folder.

  Serial monitor baud rate is set at 115200.
