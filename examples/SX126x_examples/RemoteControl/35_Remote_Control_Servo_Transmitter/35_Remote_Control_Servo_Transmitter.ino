/*******************************************************************************************************
  Program Operation - This is a remote control transmitter that uses a LoRa link to transmit the positions
  from a simple joystick to a remote receiver. The receiver uses the sent joystick positions to adjust the
  positions of servos. The postions of the joysticks potentiometers on the transmitter are read with the
  analogueRead() function.

  If the joystick has a switch, often made by pressing on the joystick, then this can be used to remote
  control an output on the receiver. The switch is read by an interrupt, the interrupt routine sets a flag
  byte which is read in loop().

  The program is intended as a proof of concept demonstration of how to remote control servos, the program
  is not designed as a practical remote control device for RC model cars for instance.

  It would be straight forward to make the transmitter program send packets continuously, but in most places
  in the world that would break a normal limitation of 10% duty cycle for unlicensed use. Therefore the
  program was designed to only transmit at a 10% duty cycle. Thus the fastest (lowest air time) packets are
  used, spreading factor 6 at a bandwidth of 500khz. This results in an air time for the 5 byte control
  packet of around 4mS, so there are around 25 sent per second.

  To have the transmitter program print out the values read from the joystick, comment in the line;

  //#define DEBUG

  Which is just above the loop() function. With the DEBUG enabled the transmission rate, the rate at which
  the control packets are transmitted will be slowed down.

  To reduce the risk of the receiver picking up LoRa packets from other sources, the packet sent contains a
  'TXidentity' number, valid values are 0 - 65535. The receiver must be setup with the matching identity
  number or the received packets will be ignored.

  The pin definitions, LoRa frequency and LoRa modem settings are in the Settings.h file. These settings
  are not necessarily optimised for long range.

  Serial monitor baud rate is set at 115200.
