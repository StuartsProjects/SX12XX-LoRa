title: "Reliable Packets with LoRa"
---

## Reliable Packets

It would be helpful, and in some cases essential, if you could be really sure that a received LoRa packet was actually destined for a particular receiver and that it also contained valid sensor or control data for the application the receiver is running.

It is inevitable that at some stage a LoRa receiver will get a packet from a foreign or unwanted source, so some thought needs to be done to be sure these rogue packets are rejected. 

### Sending and receiving reliable packets with cyclic redundancy checks

The examples in this folder use a series of SX12xx library routines that append to the transmitted packets the CRC of the data payload. The receiver can then read this CRC from the packet and then do a local CRC check on the received payload to check there is a match. If there is no match, the packet is automatically rejected. 

Additional protection is added to the packet by the use of a 16 bit NetworkID. The NetworkID number (0-65535) is defined for a particular application so the transmitter and receiver need to use the same NetworkID. The receiver will then reject packets that do not match its own defined NetworkID. The NetworkID can also be used to direct packets to particular receivers.

The CRC and NetworkID checking operates within the library transmit and receive functions in the background and although there are library routines to extract the payload CRC and NetworkID, there in no compelling need for the Arduino sketch itself to do so.

The packet structure used for a reliable packet is;

<payload - 0 to 251 bytes> <NetworkID - 2 bytes> <payload CRC - 2 bytes>

The use of the payload CRC and NetworkID adds a high level of certainty that the packet received is valid and safe to act on. If you so wish the CRC checking can be disabled and the NetworkID alone used to check packet validity. 


## Reliable packet demonstration examples

There are a number of examples of using reliable packets in this folder. The simplest examples are 201\_Reliable\_Transmitter and  201\_Reliable\_Receiver which transmit and receive a short payload 'Hello World'. 

### Examples '201\_Reliable\_Transmitter' and '202\_Reliable\_Receiver'.

The basic reliable transmit function used is;

LT.transmitReliable(buff, sizeof(buff), NetworkID, TXtimeout, TXpower, WAIT\_TX))

The buff defined in the transmit function is the name of a byte array that has been loaded with the payload, this can either be a sequence of characters, numbers or a structure. The receiver function also needs to know the size of this byte array. NetworkID is the ID for a particular application and needs to match the ID in the receiver. TXtimeout is the time in mS to wait for a transmission to finish, its used to stop the LoRa device potentially locking up a sketch\program. TXpower is the transmit power in dBm to be used and WAIT_TX tells the function to wait for the transmit to complete before exiting. 

The matching receive function is;

LT.receiveReliable(RXBUFFER, RXBUFFER\_SIZE, NetworkID, RXtimeout, WAIT\_RX);

The receiver fills the defined RXBUFFER with the contents of the received packet if its valid. The size of this buffer\array specified in RXBUFFER\_SIZE needs to be large enough to accommodate the largest payload size intended to be received. Due to the 4 bytes used by the packet for the networkID and payload CRC, the largest payload that can be received is 251 bytes.

The payload is copied on receive into the RXBUFFER array. If the transmitted payload array is say 16 bytes long, and the transmit function increases the packet size by 4 to accommodate the networkID and payload CRC the packet length will be 20 bytes. Note that any packets arriving with a length greater than the size defined for RXBUFFER plus 4 bytes will be rejected.  

The NetworkID specified in the receive function has to match that used by the transmitter if the packet is to be accepted. 

The RXtimeout parameter is the number of milli seconds the receive function will wait for a packet to be received, if the period is exceeded a time-out will be reported. To not use the time-out function set RXtimeout to 0. 

WAIT\_RX makes the receive function wait for the receipt of a packet to complete before exiting.

The transmitter program prints to the Arduino IDE serial monitor the NetworkID and payloadCRC (the payload is "Hello World") and when the receiver picks up the packet this payload should also be printed out. If the networkID of the transmitter does not match the networkID of the receiver the receiver reports the error. If the payload CRC that the transmitter appends to the packet does not match the CRC that the receiver calculates on the payload, this is also reported as an error. 

Thus in the receive program '202\_Basic\_Reliable\_Receiver' the code in the 'packet\_is\_OK()' function is only executed it the received packet passes both the networkID and payload CRC checks. 

With these example programs if you change the NetworkID either in the transmit or receive program and you should see the receiver rejects them.

The transmitter program output looks like this;

	Transmit Payload > Hello World
	LocalNetworkID,0x3210,TransmittedPayloadCRC,0xBC69
If the receiver reports a valid packet which passes networkID and CRC checks the output looks like;

	Payload received OK > Hello World
	LocalNetworkID,0x3210,TransmitterNetworkID,0x3210,LocalPayloadCRC,0xBC69,RXPayloadCRC,0xBC69
If the networkID check fails the output can look like this;

	Error LocalNetworkID,0x3210,TransmitterNetworkID,0x55AB,LocalPayloadCRC,0xBC69,RXPayloadCRC,0xBC69

If the payload CRC check fails the output looks like;

	Error LocalNetworkID,0x3210,TransmitterNetworkID,0x1234,LocalPayloadCRC,0xBC69,RXPayloadCRC,0xBC69,ReliableIDError
If you don't want to use the CRC checking of the payload it can be turned off with this command;

	LT.setReliableConfig(NoReliableCRC);      //disable payload CRC check

You need to use the command on both the transmitter and the receiver. 


## Using reliable packets to control stuff

Sending Hello World messages is a useful start but a more practical example is to use the payload to control something on the receiver. The reliable examples show how the sent payload can be a structure, writing variables direct to an array and how to write the payload direct into the LoRa devices internal buffer and thus bypassing the need for an memory array.  

### Using a structure

The next example 203\_Reliable\_Transmitter\_Controller\_Structure uses a structure as the payload;

	struct controllerStructure
	{
  	uint16\_t destinationNode;
  	uint8\_t outputNumber;
  	uint8\_t onoroff;
	};

The destinationNode is a 16 bit number that the receiver reads to see if the received packet is destined for that receiver. You can set outputNumber to control a range of outputs and onoroff is set to 1 to turn on the output and to 0 to turn it on. 

With the 203 transmitter example running load the 204\_Reliable\_Receiver\_Controller\_Structure program onto the receiver Arduino and it should report the packets received and the LED connected to the pin defined by LED1 should flash on and off. 

These structure examples would be easy to expand to control more outputs such as servos and similar. 

**Note:** Structures on different Arduino types can use different formats. If the transmitter is one Arduino type and the receiver is another type the receiver may not be able to read the transferred structure correctly. 

## Writing variables direct to an array

A SX12xx library file, arrayRW.h has routines that allow for variables to be directly written to an array. For example if the name of the array is 'controlarray' and then if you review the transmitter program, 205\_Reliable\_Transmitter\_Controller\_ArrayRW, you will see it fills the array with variables like this;

	beginarrayRW(controlarray, 0);                //start writing to array at location 0
	arrayWriteUint16(destinationNode);
	arrayWriteUint8(outputNumber);
	arrayWriteUint8(onoroff);                     //0 for off, 1 for on
	controlarraysize = endarrayRW();              //this function returns the length of the array to send 

When the 206\_Reliable\_Receive\_Controller\_ArrayRW program receives the packet its loaded into a defined array (RXBUFFER in the example) and the sketch then reads the variables from the the array like this;

	beginarrayRW(RXBUFFER, 0);                     //start reading from array at location 0
	destinationNode = arrayReadUint16();
	outputNumber = arrayReadUint8();
	onoroff = arrayReadUint8();                    //0 for off, 1 for on
	controlarraysize = endarrayRW();               //this function returns the length of the array to send


As with the previous examples the LED on the receiver should flash on and off.

The full set of write variable functions provided by the arrayRW.h library file is;

	arrayWriteUint8(uint8_t buffdata)
	arrayWriteInt8(int8_t buffdata)
	arrayWriteChar(char buffdata)
	arrayWriteUint16(uint16_t buffdata)
	arrayWriteInt16(int16_t buffdata)
	arrayWriteFloat(float tempf)
	arrayWriteUint32(uint32_t tempdata)
	arrayWriteInt32(int32_t tempdata)
	arrayWriteCharArray(char *buff, uint8_t len)
	arrayWriteByteArray(uint8_t *buff, uint8_t len)

And the read functions are;

	uint8_t arrayReadUint8()
	int8_t arrayReadInt8()
	char arrayReadChar()
	uint16_t arrayReadUint16()
	int16_t arrayReadInt16()
	float arrayReadFloat()
	uint32_t arrayReadUint32()
	int32_t arrayReadInt32()
	arrayReadCharArray(char *buff, uint8_t len)
	arrayReadByteArray(uint8_t *buff, uint8_t len)
 

## Low memory controller

Programs 207\_Reliable\_SXTransmitter\_Controller and 208\_Reliable\_SXReceiver\_Controller demonstrate how use the SX12XX library to directly write and read variables to and from the LoRa devices internal buffer directly for transmit and receive functions. There is no memory array required to be defined filled or used by transmitter and receiver programs. If large packets are being sent and received this can save a significant amount of memory.  

The 207 and 208 examples follow the same controller example of programs 203 and 204 in that an LED on the receiver should flash on and off.

The transmitter packet is loaded into the LoRa devices buffer like this;

	LT.startWriteSXBuffer(0);                          //start the write at SX12XX internal buffer location 0
	LT.writeUint16(destinationNode);                   //destination node for packet 
	LT.writeUint8(outputNumber);                       //output number on receiver
	LT.writeUint8(onoroff);                            //0 for off, 1 for on
	TXPayloadL = LT.endWriteSXBuffer();                //closes packet write and returns the length of the payload to send

And the receiver loads the variables from the LoRa devices buffer like this;

	LT.startReadSXBuffer(0);                       //start buffer read at location 0
	destinationNode = LT.readUint16();             //load the destination node 
	outputNumber = LT.readUint8();                 //load the output number
	onoroff = LT.readUint8();                      //0 for off, 1 for on
	RXPayloadL = LT.endReadSXBuffer();             //this function returns the length of the array read

Clearly with these direct accesses to the LoRa devices buffer the order and type of variables written has to match the order when read out by the receiver.

The full set of library routines for writing direct to the LoRa devices buffer is;

	writeUint8(uint8_t x);
    writeInt8(int8_t x);
    writeChar(char x);
    writeUint16(uint16_t x);
    writeInt16(int16_t x);
    writeUint32(uint32_t x);
    writeInt32(int32_t x);
    writeFloat(float x);
    writeBuffer(uint8_t *txbuffer, uint8_t size);   //uint8_t buffer
    writeBufferChar(char *txbuffer, uint8_t size);  //char buffer

And for reading direct from the LoRa devices buffer;

    uint8_t readUint8();
    int8_t readInt8();
    char readChar();
    uint16_t readUint16();
    int16_t readInt16();
    uint32_t readUint32();
    int32_t readInt32();
    float readFloat();
    uint8_t readBuffer(uint8_t *rxbuffer);          //reads buffer till a null 0x00 is reached
    uint8_t readBuffer(uint8_t *rxbuffer, uint8_t size);
    uint8_t readBufferChar(char *rxbuffer);


#### Getting the payload CRC into a sketch

The CRC of the transmitted payload, that is appended to the packet and printed out in the examples, can be obtained by the sketch in several ways, first the simplest way is to use a SX12XX library function after the packet has been transmitted or received;

	TXpayloadCRC = LT.getTXPayloadCRC(TXPacketL);
	RXpayloadCRC = LT.getRXPayloadCRC(RXPacketL);

The payload CRC can be read direct from the end of the packet buffer of the LoRa device like this;

	PayloadCRC = LT.readUint16SXBuffer(PayloadL+2);

Where PayloadL is the length in bytes of the payload, this is the method used in the 201 transmitter example. 

Or the payload CRC can be calculated locally by accessing the local payload array\buffer directly like this which uses another SX12xx library function;

	LocalPayloadCRC = LT.CRCCCITT(buff, sizeof(buff), 0xFFFF); 

Where buff is the name of the array containing the payload.
Where 0xFFFF is the CRC check start value, normally 0xFFFF.

And finally there is a SX12xx library function that will return the CRC of an area of the LoRa devices internal buffer like this;

	LT.CRCCCITTReliable(0, PayloadL-1, 0xFFFF);

Where PayloadL is the length of the payload array\buffer. 

Where 0 is the address in the buffer to start the CRC check.
Where 0xFFFF is the CRC check start value, normally 0xFFFF. 


#### Getting the NetworkID into a sketch

The NetworkID used for the transmission or reception of a packet, that is appended to the packet and printed out in the examples, can be obtained by the sketch using an SX12XX library function after the packet has been transmitted or received;

	TXNetworkID = LT.getTXNetworkID(TXPacketL);
	RXNetworkID = LT.getRXNetworkID(RXPacketL);


## Sending and receiving reliable packets with an acknowledge

Sometimes we may need to be sure the receiver has actually received the packet sent and we may want to keep transmitting the packet until it actually is received. Thus the receiver needs, when it has accepted a valid reliable packet, to send an acknowledge packet back that the transmitter will be listening for. 

Clearly we could now have the same problem as for a simple reliable packet, how does the transmitter know the received packet actually is an acknowledge from the specific receiver ? 

The simple way to be sure is to turn around the received NetworkID and payloadcrc (i.e. a total of 4 bytes) and send these bytes as an acknowledge. The transmitter program knows the NetworkID and payloadcrc used in the transmit function so can check to a high level of certainty that the received packet is a valid acknowledge, all four bytes of the acknowledge have to be correct. 


## Examples using acknowledgements

The previous examples, where there was no acknowledgement used were a very basic transmit and receive, a set of examples using a structure to control an remote output, doing the same with direct array read and write and then a low memory example writing and reading direct to the LoRa devices buffer. There are two types of acknowledgement possible with the library, the first is a simple Auto Acknowledge which is only 4 bytes, consisting of the the NetworkID and payload CRC. The second type of acknowledge allows the receiver to send back data to the transmitter. This form of acknowledge can be used when the transmitter wants to request some data or control information from the receiver. Since the original NetworkID and payload CRC used by the transmitter is sent back with the acknowledge the transmitter can be very confident that the data coming back is genuine. 

These two examples; **209\_Reliable\_Transmitter\_AutoACK** and **210\_Reliable\_Receiver\_AutoACK** are the basic 201 and 202 examples modified to use the auto acknowledge. 

The transmit function when acknowledge is configured is;

	transmitReliable(buff, sizeof(buff), NetworkID, ACKtimeout, TXtimeout, TXpower, WAIT_TX))

If AutoACK is used then a ACKtimeout needs to be specified. ACKtimeout is the milliseconds the transmit function would listen for a valid acknowledge before returning an error. How short this period is rather depends on the LoRa settings in use and the actual Arduinos being used. Remember the sending of the acknowledge will have a on-air time that the transmitter needs to account for. You can in some circumstances have an ACKtimeout as low as 25mS and that is still enough time for the receiver to turn around from receive to transmit and the transmitter to flip to receive mode and pick-up the packet. You need to experiment here, perhaps start at 1000mS and gradually reduce the time (with a working set-up) until the point is reached when the receipt of the acknowledge fails.  

With the transmit function if the returned byte is 0 this indicates to the sketch that there has been an error of some type, one such error could be no acknowledge received. 

The matching receive function is;

	receiveReliable(RXBUFFER, RXBUFFER_SIZE, NetworkID, ACKdelay, TXpower, RXtimeout, WAIT_RX);

The ACKdelay parameter is in miliseconds and it's the time the receiver waits before sending an acknowledge. With some hardware a delay here of 0mS might be OK, but with faster hardware you may need to increase it. Maybe start with an ACKdelay of 50mS and an ACKtimeout of 1000mS in the transmit function and reduce the numbers in steps. You only need to do this if you want or need to maximise response time. 

If the returned byte from the receiveReliable() function is 0 then there was a problem during receive. 

The 209 transmitter will keep sending the payload until the transmitReliable() function returns a non zero value. The transmitReliable() function will return a zero value if no acknowledge is received within the ACKtimeout period. 

Note that in the case of a NetworkID mismatch the receiver will not transmit an acknowledge, so the transmitter reports it as an a NoReliableACK error.
	
The auto acknowledge is a simple way of making the transmission of packets more reliable, but it might not be appropriate in all circumstances. For instance consider the **207\_Reliable\_Transmitter\_Controller\_LowMemory** and **208\_Reliable\_Receiver\_Controller\_LowMemory** examples where the payload contains the following;

	LT.writeUint16(destinationNode);                   //destination node for packet 
	LT.writeUint8(outputNumber);                       //output number on receiver
	LT.writeUint8(onoroff);                            //0 for off, 1 for on

Here the destinationNode number is directed to a particular node number, 2 in that example. If the packet is received by node number 5, then there should be no acknowledge sent. In these circumstances the receiver program needs to intervene directly on the received packet, read the payload and check for a matching destinationNode number. If there is a match then an acknowledge can be sent manually and the transmitter knows the packet has been received. 

## Low memory acknowledge 

Example programs **211\_Reliable\_SXTransmitter\_AutoACK** and **212\_Reliable\_SXReceiver\_AutoACK** demonstrate how to use the SX12xx library functions to bypass the need to use an intermediate array for the payload. Instead of filling an array with a structure or byte array full of variables, the variables to send are written directly to the LoRa device internal buffer on transmit and read from the buffer on receive. 

Filling the SX12XX LoRa devices buffer is done like so;

	LT.startWriteSXBuffer(0);                     //start the write at SX12XX internal buffer location 0
    LT.writeUint16(destinationNode);              //destination node for packet
    LT.writeUint8(outputNumber);                  //output number on receiver
    LT.writeUint8(onoroff);                       //0 for off, 1 for on
    TXPayloadL = LT.endWriteSXBuffer();           //closes packet write and returns the length of the payload to send
 
And then the appropriate transmit function is used;

	TXPacketL = LT.transmitSXReliableAutoACK(0, TXPayloadL, NetworkID, ACKtimeout, TXtimeout, TXpower, WAIT_TX);  

On the receive side the receive is setup like so;

	PacketOK = LT.receiveSXReliableAutoACK(0, NetworkID, ACKdelay, TXpower, RXtimeout, WAIT_RX);

And if on receive the packet passes the NetworkID and payloadCRC checks (PacketOK returns > 0) it is read like this;

	LT.startReadSXBuffer(0);                       //start buffer read at location 0
  	destinationNode = LT.readUint16();             //load the destination node
  	outputNumber = LT.readUint8();                 //load the output number
  	onoroff = LT.readUint8();                      //0 for off, 1 for on
  	RXPayloadL = LT.endReadSXBuffer();             //this function returns the length of the array read

Note that in this example the payload contains a 16 bit destinationNode variable, which can be used to direct the packet to one of many nodes. The sketch checks that the destinationNode matches the number given to that receiver and if there is a match actions the packet. 


## Manual acknowledge

The programs **213\_Reliable\_Transmitter\_Controller\_ManualACK** and **214\_Reliable\_Receiver\_Controller\_ManualACK** use a manual acknowledge set-up whereby the receive picks up the transmitted payload and reads the destinationNode parameter to decide if the packet is destined for that node. If it is the acknowledge is sent which contains the networkID and the CRC of the original payload, thus the transmitter knows the sent packet has been received correctly. 

The receive sketch can pause at the point the payload is being actioned, perhaps reading an external sensor waiting for conformation that the action as completed, a gate is confirmed opened\closed for instance, before sending the acknowledge. 

There is a further enhancement to the manual acknowledge set-up, the acknowledge can contain some data to be returned to the transmitter. 

## Manual acknowledge returning data

The standard acknowledge is only 4 bytes, the NetworkID and payload CRC. However the acknowledge can be sent with an array of data included in the acknowledge.

The format of this function is;

	transmitReliableACK(uint8\_t *txbuffer, uint8\_t size, uint16\_t networkID, uint16\_t payloadcrc, int8\_t txpower);  

Here the receiver sending the acknowledge can include an array txbuffer of a specified size. This returned array could be a structure, as per example 203 and 204 or an array filled directly with the arrayRW.h library file as used in examples 205 and 206.

To demonstrate returning an array in the acknowledge examples 201 and 202 were modified so that the transmitted 'Hello World' example has 'Goodbye' returned from the receiver with the acknowledge and is then printed out on the transmitter. The modified programs are **215\_Reliable\_Transmitter\_ManualACK\_withData** and **216\_Reliable\_Receiver\_ManualACK\_withData**


## Requesting data

We can use the acknowledge functions of reliable packets to send a request to a remote station to transfer data. The returned data will include the networkID and payloadCRC sent with the request and since the returned data\packet is also protected by the internal LoRa packet CRC we can be fairly confident we are getting valid data back. 

Take for instance a remote node that has a GPS attached and we want to know the current location of the node. Of course the node could transmit its location on a regular basis but this can be wasteful of power and there will be issues with conflicting transmissions if there are a number of nodes out there. 

Examples **217\_Reliable\_Transmitter\_Data\_Requestor** and **218\_Reliable\_Receiver\_Data\_Requestor** demonstrate such a requesting of data.

Assume at the station wanting the remote nodes location we send this payload;

	LT.startWriteSXBuffer(0);                   //initialise SX buffer write at address 0
    LT.writeUint8(RequestGPSLocation);          //identify type of packet
    LT.writeUint8(RequestStation);              //station to reply to request
    TXPayloadL = LT.endWriteSXBuffer();         //close SX buffer write 

RequestGPSLocation is assigned a value of 1;

	const uint8_t RequestGPSLocation = 1;

RequestStation is from 0 to 255 and is the station node\number that we want the location from, in this case RequestStation will have a number of 123. 

The packet is protected by the NetworkID and payload CRC so station 123 will see the request as valid and loads the location data into the LoRa device like this;

	LT.startWriteSXBuffer(0);                   //initialise SX buffer write at address 0
    LT.writeUint8(RequestGPSLocation);          //identify type of request
    LT.writeUint8(ThisStation);                 //who is the request reply from
    LT.writeFloat(TestLatitude);                //add latitude
    LT.writeFloat(TestLongitude);               //add longitude
    LT.writeFloat(TestAltitude);                //add altitude
    TXPayloadL = LT.endWriteSXBuffer();         //close SX buffer write

In this case the returned values are test values of Latitude, Longitude and Altitude. 

The original requesting node sees that the valid reply\Acknowledge is a GPS location request from station 123 and can then act on the data.

Examples **219\_Reliable\_Transmitter\_Data\_RequestorIRQ** and **220\_Reliable\_Receiver\_Data\_RequestorIRQ** are versions of the above 217 and 218 examples that do not require access to the DIO1 pin on the LoRa device to detect RXdone and TXDone. These versions can be useful for situations where there are few microcontroller pins available to drive the LoRa device such as with the ESP32CAM for instance.  


## Using program 221\_LoRa\_Packet\_Monitor or 222\_FLRC\_Packet\_Monitor

When debugging what's going on in a send and acknowledge set-up its useful to be able to see what is happening in real time. This packet monitor example will display the bytes received in hexadecimal, in the example printout below you can see two packets. The 16 byte packet contains the text 'Hello World' and then the NetworkID, 0x3210, then the payload CRC, 0xBC69 at the end. 

The 4 byte packet that is seen around 130mS later is the acknowledge which contains the NetworkID, 0x3210, then the payload CRC, 0xBC69. 


	125.103 RSSI,-99dBm,SNR,10dB  16 bytes > 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 57 6F 72 6C 64 00 10 32 69 BC 
	125.237 RSSI,-96dBm,SNR,8dB  4 bytes > 10 32 69 BC

## LoRa versus FLRC packets

The SX128x devices support both LoRa and Fast Long Range Communication (FLRC) packets. The modem settings for the two types of packet are different. Both modulations are long range type modulations but the FLRC packets are capable of a faster air rate than LoRa, 1300Kbps for FLRC versus 200kbps for LoRa. LoRa allows a packet length of up to 255 bytes whilst FLRC is retricted to 127 bytes.
