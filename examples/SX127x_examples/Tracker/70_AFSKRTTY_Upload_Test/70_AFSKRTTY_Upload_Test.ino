  Program Operation - This test program has been written to check that the hardware for sending AFSK RTTY
  been connected correctly. AFSK RTTY can be used to upload packets received from a high altitude balloon
  tracker as LoRa into DL-FLDIGI running on a PC and from there uploaded to an Internet connected tracking
  system.

  The AFSK RTTY library has been tested and will work on an Arduion Pro Mini 8Mhz, Arduino DUE and ESP32
  when used with this startup command;

  startAFSKRTTY(AUDIOOUTpin, CHECKpin, 5, 1000, 7, 714, 0, 1000);

  This outputs AFSKRTTY at 200baud, 7 databits, 1 startbit, 2 stopbits, no parity, low tone 1000hz, hightone 1400hz.

  The audio comes out of the pin passed via AUDIOOUTpin and the bit timing can be checked by looking at
  the CHECKpin on a scope or analyser.

  A low pass filter consiting of a deries 47K resistor and parallel 470nF capacitor was used to reduce the output
  for feeding into a PC soundcard.

  A screenshot of the FLDIGI settings used is in the folder containing this program; 'AFSKRTTY2_DL-Fldigi_Settings.jpg'

  Serial monitor baud rate is set at 9600
