//*******  Setup hardware pin definitions here ! ***************

//These are the pin definitions for one of the Tracker boards, the ESP32_Micro_Node, be sure to change
//them to match your own setup. You will also need to connect up the pins for the SPI bus, which on the
//ESP32_Micro_Node are SCK on pin 18, MISO on pin 19 and MOSI on pin 23. Some pins such as DIO1, DIO2 and
//BUZZER may not be in used by this sketch so they do not need to be connected and should be set to -1.


#define SWITCH1 0                    //pin number for switch, the boot switch also 
#define LED1 2                       //pin number for LED
#define NSS 5                        //pin number where the NSS line for the LoRa device is connected

#define VCCPOWER 14                  //pin controls power to external devices
#define DIO2 15                      //pin number for DIO2 pin on LoRa device
#define TonePin 15                   //pin number for LoRa radio tone generation, connects to LoRa device pin DIO2
#define GPSTX 16                     //pin number for TX output from Arduino - RX into GPS
