/*******************************************************************************************************
  Program Operation - This is a basic demonstration of the transmission of a 'Reliable' packet used to
  control outputs on a remote receiver.

  A reliable packet has 4 bytes automatically appended to the end of the buffer\array that is the data
  payload. The first two bytes appended are a 16bit 'NetworkID'. This receiver needs to have the same
  NetworkID as configured for the transmitter. The receiver program uses the NetworkID to check that
  the received packet is from a known source.  The third and fourth bytes appended is a 16 bit CRC of
  the payload. The receiver will carry out its own CRC check on the received payload and can then verify
  this against the CRC appended to the packet. The receiver is thus able to check if the payload is valid.

  For a packet to be accepted by the receiver, the networkID and payload CRC appended to the packet by the
  transmitter need to match those from the receiver which gives a high level of assurance that the packet
  is valid.

  This example program and the matching receiver, 204_Reliable_Receiver_Controller_Structure, transmits a
  data structure that contains variables which when read by the remote receiver flashes an LED attached to
  the receiver on and off.

  When using these transmit and receive examples the Arduino types should be the same as the structure
  formats can be different on some Arduinos.

  Serial monitor baud rate should be set at 115200.
